# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In previous courses we talked about how clean, maintainable code goes hand-in-hand with modularity and scalability. As an example, Project One, where I built a CRUD Python module with clear, single-purpose functions. Each method had its own job, (creating, reading, updating, or deleting) which made it easy to understand and reuse later on.
By keeping things separated and giving each block of code a specific role, it becomes easier to debug or update things without breaking the whole system because I knew where everything was in a neat category. That came in handy during Project Two, where I was able to plug my dashboard widgets into the database quickly just by reusing those functions. Honestly, I could see myself reusing this CRUD module again for future dashboards or backend projects. Every time I work with MongoDB, having this kind of centralized module just save me time and cuts down on bugs, no need to rewrite the same boilerplate code every time.  


# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I would approach a problem as a computer scientist the same way I would handle any big task, by breaking it down into smaller, manageable parts, with the foresight of well understood tools I’m working with. For this project, that meant diving into what MongoDB and Dash are capable of, figuring out how they could help meet the client’s needs, and then mapping out the best way to build each part of the dashboard around that.
One thing that really shaped my approach here was thinking from the client’s perspective, empathetic thinking is a term that could be used to describe how I try to figure out what features matter most, and how the system should feel to use, not just whether it technically works. That’s the shift from past projects where the goal was mostly just to hit the requirements and call it done,
What I’ve taken away from this course is that coding for a client will require forward thinking with the user in mind.  It’s more about the user experience, and making sure the system as modular and easily adjustable down the line. So, in future projects, I can reuse code effectively and perhaps even put more time or effort into the UX or user navigation experience.


# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

I vaguely remember the definition, but I like to think of computer science as the study of how to communicate with machines better than most. It’s one things to write code, and another to write it optimally; Computer scientists and software engineers create systems that help people solve problems, automate tasks and make complex processes easier to manage.
In this project, for example, I Built a dashboard that helped Grazioso Salvare better categorize and identify rescue dogs. On the surface, it might seem like I was just putting together a data display, but really, it was about giving the client a tool that helps them make faster, smart decisions in real emergencies. That kind of impact matters.
Computer scientists play a big role in turning abstract ideas into real, working systems that people and companies can depend on. Whether it’s for emergency response, healthcare, education, or finance, we’re the one designing the digital tools that make things work better, faster and at scale.
